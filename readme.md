# The Alchemist's Companion
This repository contains the deliverables produced as part of my final year Master's thesis, titled "An Intelligent Scrabble Board for Alchemist 2024", which obtained a score of 86.90%. The aim of this project was to produce a system for competitive Scrabble analogous to existing technology in Chess, allowing for matches to be digitized in real-time with players facing off against each other across a physical board to enhance the viewer and caster experience. A variety of potential solutions for this complex task were explored in the paper, before a QR-based embedded camera approach prototype was developed and presented, suitable for deployment for the Alchemist Cup 2024 tournament.

## Deliverables
You can find my [interim report](interim_report.pdf) produced in the initial, exploratory phase of the project, as well as the [final report](final_report.pdf), the most significant deliverable which details the work done and outcomes attained by the project. A recording of the final presentation is also [available online](https://youtu.be/L67i8ipmLMw), and although the audio quality isn't fantastic, highlights the solution developed in action. As mentionned in the final report, all code developed during the project is available on the [Alchemist Cup](https://github.com/AlchemistCup) GitHub organisation.
